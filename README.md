## The Response

---
Thank you for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about new and exciting opportunities out there.

As a `<job-title>` I'm sure you can imagine that I get a high volume of recruiters reaching out to me. I'm grateful to be in this privileged place in my career. However, this also means that I don't have the time to talk or respond personally with everyone who reaches out. Most of the time, the potential positions don't match my expectations or qualifications. While exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters do contact me, sorting high-quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.

I may want to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like some clarity about the position about which you are inquiring. Can you please send the company name, job description, and total compensation details for the role you are referencing? Without this information about the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.

Thanks again for reaching out. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

`<name>`
